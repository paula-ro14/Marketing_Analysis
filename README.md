# Marketing_Analysis
This project is to create customer segmentation (K-means) and to show their preferences as groups.


# How's it looking?
                  looking good! 😎
                  
With a data set from Kaggle - marketing analytics by Jack Daoud I was able to run a model to determine customer segmentation!
With 2205 rows and 38 columns I looked into customer profiles and their preferences to create a better marketing strategy for the future.

After the analysis made with PCA and K-means cluster, I found 4 groups that captured all of our 2205 customers. 
What I found is a premium group followed by almost a tie with other two groups, and a pretty graph showing the group preferences! 🛒

would you like to know more about the groups and their characteristics⁉️ go ahead and read the code... OR!!

thank you!💗
